<b>Objective: </b>Reach 200 points to win the game.
<b>How the game is played: </b>The game will restart automatically in case a player serves 5 or more doubles.
The player with the double six starts the first round. While with 3 players or less the highest double starts the game (double 5, double 4, double 3, double 2, double 1, if there is no double 6). In case there is no double at the start of the round, the player with the highest tile starts, this only applies for 2 or 3 players.
After placing the first tile, the next players must join a tile from their hand with an open end on the playing line. Then, in the second round, the player to their right follows, counterclockwise, and so on. The ends of the two tiles that are joined must have the same number of pints.
If a player cannot make a move with his hand, he must draw tiles from the graveyard until he draws a playable tile. If a player cannot make a move with his hand and there are no tiles left in the graveyard, the player must skip his turn until he can make a move.
<b>Points: </b> A player receives points each time he/she makes a move that results in the open ends of the tiles in the line of play adding up to a multiple of 5 (5 points for 5 pints; 10 points for 10 pints; 15 points for 15 pints, and so on). The player who wins the round also receives points at the end of each hand by adding up and rounding to the nearest multiple of 5, the pints of chips remaining in the hands of his opponents.
Only 1 or 2 pints are worth nothing; 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are worth 5 points; 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are worth 10 points; and so on. The first player to reach 200 points wins the game.
If a player reaches 200 points during the game, the game ends at that point. If points are counted at the end of a hand and more than one player has a score of 200 or more, the player with the highest score wins.
<b>In case of a tie, follow these rules: </b> If you are playing 2, play two more rounds; 3 players, play three more rounds; 4 players, play four more rounds.
<b>In case of a deadlock with a tie: </b> no points are scored for any player, Example: Deadlocked game and 4 points are left for each player = points are not distributed and in the next hand the player who was the hand in that deadlocked hand goes out.
<b>Scoring if the hand is locked: </b> each player counts the pints of the remaining tiles in his hand. The player with the lowest number of pints scores the difference between his total and that of each of his opponents. Then, the player with the next lowest number of pints scores the difference between his total and that of each of his opponents, and so on.
<b>Graveyard: </b> In case of 3 players or less; players take 7 tiles each, leaving the remaining tiles on one side of the table, the player who has no tiles in his hand must "take" tiles from the graveyard, one by one, until he finds one that can be placed in that round.
