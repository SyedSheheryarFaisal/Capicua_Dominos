<b>Objective: </b> To score the least amount of points, the game ends when 1 player completes 121 points or more.
<b>How the game is played: </b> The game will restart automatically in case a player draws 5 or more doubles.
The player with the double six starts the first round. While with 3 players or less the highest double starts the game (double 5, double 4, double 3, double 2, double 1, if there is no double 6). In case there is no double at the start of the round, the player with the highest tile starts, this only applies for 2 or 3 players. After placing the first tile, the next players must join a tile from their hand with an open end on the playing line. Then, in the second round, the player to their right follows, counterclockwise, and so on.
After several rounds, the game ends when a player manages to score 121 points or more, and the opponent with the fewest points wins the game.
If two or more players have tied their scores to define the winner, all the tiles are turned over, each player must draw a tile at random, and the player who draws the tile with the lowest number of pints is the winner.
<b>Points: </b> Each player must count the number of pints on his remaining tiles and the player with the highest score will have all the points added up.
<b>Locked: </b> the player with the most pints loses, and the pints of the other players are added up. In case of a tie between one or more players, the tiles will be mixed and each player must draw one, then the highest number will be the player who loses.
<b>Graveyard: </b> In case of 3 players or less; players draw 7 tiles each, leaving the remaining tiles on one side of the table, the player who has no tiles in his hand must "draw" tiles from the graveyard, one by one, until he finds one that can be placed in that round.
