<b>Objective: </b>To reach or exceed 100 points.
<b>How the game is played: </b>The game will restart automatically in case a player serves 5 or more doubles.
The player with the double six starts the first round. While with 3 players or less the highest double starts the game (double 5, double 4, double 3, double 2, double 1, if there is no double 6). In case there is no double at the start of the round, the player with the highest tile starts, this only applies for 2 or 3 players.
After placing the first tile, the next players must join a tile from their hand with an open end on the playing line. Then, in the second round, the player to their right follows, counterclockwise, and so on. The following rounds are started by whoever won the previous game. The next checker is placed by the player to his right. Whoever has no tiles to place is said to have dominated. A losing player will have to shuffle the tiles.
<b>Points: </b> The sum of all points is awarded to the player who ran out of pieces in his hand.
<b>Run pass: </b> if at any time a player gives a run pass (since none of the other players have the pieces to play), the player who gave that run pass is awarded 25 points according to the rules.
<b>Starting Points: </b> At the moment of placing the first checker, the immediate opponent cannot play, the player who started is credited with 25 points.
<b>Blocked: </b> In case of a block, the player with the least amount of points is the winner. In case they add the same amount of points in the blockade, the player who started in that round will be the winner and will be the one who starts in the next round. The player of the round is the one who starts and the player to his right would be the next player of the round.
<b>Graveyard: </b> In case of 3 players or less; players take 7 tiles each, leaving the remaining tiles on one side of the table, the player who has no tiles in his hand must "take" tiles from the graveyard, one by one, until he finds one that can be placed in that round.
