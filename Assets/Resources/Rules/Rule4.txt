<b>Objective: </b>The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 20 points.
<b>How the game is played: </b>The game will restart automatically in case a player serves 5 or more doubles.
The player with the double six starts the first round. While with 3 players or less the highest double starts the game (double 5, double 4, double 3, double 2, double 1, if there is no double 6). In case there is no double at the start of the round, the player with the highest tile starts, this only applies for 2 or 3 players.
After placing the first tile, the next players must join a tile from their hand with an open end on the playing line. The winner of the previous hand starts, regardless of whether he/she gets a double or not. Then, in the second round, the player to his right follows, counterclockwise, and so on.
<b>Points: </b> Each pass is 2 points, but when playing with less than 4 players, the player who has no checkers must grab the ones in the graveyard. At the end of the tiles left in the graveyard, if a player passes automatically, 2 points will be added to the player who made his opponent pass.
The sum of all points is awarded to the player who ran out of chips in his hand.
The points are given by the sum of all the tiles scored as follows: from 0 to 2 pints 1 point, from 3 to 20 pints, 2 points; from 21 to 30 pints, 3 points; from 31 to 40 pints, 4 points and so on. The first to reach 20 points wins.
<b>Blocked: </b> In case of blocking, the points are counted individually and the player with the lowest number of points wins. In case they add up the same amount of points in the block, the player who started in that hand will be the winner and will be the one who starts in the next hand. The player of the hand is the one who starts and the player to his right would be the next player in the hand.
<b>Capicua: </b> used in Capicua mode. If a player places his last tile, and it can be placed from both ends, it is said to be Capicua, and double the points won in that hand are added to the person who made the Capicua. If the tile is double, then there is no Capicua.
<b>Shoe to Shoemaker: </b> It is called "Shoemaker" when the winner reaches 20 points while the opponent reaches none (make a distinctive sound when this happens).
<b>Graveyard: </b> In case of 3 players or less; players take 7 tiles each, leaving the remaining tiles on one side of the table, the player who has no tiles in his hand must "take" tiles from the graveyard, one by one, until he finds one that can be placed in that round.
